## Photographed and featured in newspapers around the world 


(2015) Richard Vevers [The ocean Agency](https://www.theoceanagency.org/) took this picture of me while filming bleaching on Lizard Island during the production of [Chasing Coral](https://www.chasingcoral.com/). Since then, this picture has been showed in many international journals, including the New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, etc. The experience with Chasing Coral convinced me how important communication is for scientists. The general public should know what we are doing as scientists. People have the right to be aware, and we must pass the message, so please reach out if you work in science communication.
